## Do electric cars need oil changes?
- EVs do not require oil which is necessary to lubricate the number of moving parts in a combustion engine. EVs are powered by electric motors, not the oil mandatory engines.
- Although your electric car does not need oil, it requires a routine check on these 3 fluids in EVs: Coolant, brake fluid, and windshield washing fluid.
  - Coolant: Electric cars rely on coolant flowing through the thermoregulation system to prevent the batteries from overheating. You need to add and replace the coolant during the maintenance.
  - Brake Fluid: A regenerative braking system relies on the brake fluid to work smoothly. Normally, the brake fluid in electric cars should be replaced after running about 40,000km (25,000miles)
  - Windshield Washing Fluid: Depending on the usage of windshield washing fluid, you should refill it as often as needed.
